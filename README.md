# General Information
This project is the example of how simple things can eqsily become compilcated if you apply enough will to make them that way.
The original task for this repository is to silve square equation, but here is a catch: program should be written as I would write mush bigger project that can not be done in a few lines of code.
The project contains libraries for solving equation, printing solution in specific form, logging and debugging.
There are also tools for testing and compiling project in specific ways (check makefile for that).
